# Smart Object Detection App

A powerful web-based object detection application built with TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model. This project can identify and locate 80 different types of objects in real-time through your webcam or uploaded images.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Live object detection using your webcam
- **Image Upload**: Analyze objects in your own photos
- **80 Object Classes**: Detects people, animals, vehicles, furniture, and more
- **Browser-based**: No installation required - runs directly in your web browser
- **Fast & Accurate**: Powered by Google's pre-trained COCO-SSD model
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## üéØ What Can It Detect?

The app can identify common objects including:
- **People & Body Parts**: person, hand, face
- **Animals**: dog, cat, bird, horse, cow, sheep
- **Vehicles**: car, truck, bus, motorcycle, bicycle, airplane
- **Food**: apple, banana, sandwich, pizza, cake
- **Electronics**: laptop, phone, TV, keyboard, mouse
- **Furniture**: chair, table, sofa, bed
- And many more!

## üì± How to Use

1. **Open the Demo**: Navigate to the `demo` folder and open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Choose Input**: Select between webcam or file upload
3. **Start Detection**: Click "Start" to begin real-time object detection
4. **View Results**: See detected objects highlighted with bounding boxes and confidence scores
